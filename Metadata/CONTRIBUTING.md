Contributing ðŸš€
===============

For fixes, improvements or ideas, fork the repository and issue a pull request.

To get a pull request accepted, please adhere to these rules:
- Work from the latest `develop` branch.
- Respect current code style and respect the [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) rules (see swiftlint's file).
- If this is about new features, please make sure to add enable/disable configuration.

Ideally, only work on one feature at a time.
If you've done work on the code (i.e. not just fixes to the README), add yourself to the top of [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Thank you, and happy coding ! ðŸ˜˜
